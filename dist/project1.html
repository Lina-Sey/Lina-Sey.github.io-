            <h3>Moving to a new city for university can be an exciting yet overwhelming experience for first-year students. Social integration plays a crucial role in making students feel at home, but many struggle to find relevant events due to a lack of centralized information sources. This case study explores the design and development of MainLife, a mobile application aimed at facilitating first-year students' access to social events in Würzburg. The project was conducted as part of the Methods of <i>User-Centered Design</i> course in collaboration with the <i>stadt.land.smart</i> initiative.</h3>
            <h3 class="subcaption">Goal</h3>
            <h3>First-year students face multiple barriers when trying to participate in social events:</h3>
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li>Limited knowledge of the city and available events</li>
                <li>Lack of a central platform for event information</li>
                <li>Reliance on scattered sources such as WhatsApp groups, Instagram, and word of mouth</li>
                <li>Difficulty in coordinating attendance with new acquaintances</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The goal of MainLife was to create a user-centered solution that simplifies event discovery, provides relevant recommendations, and fosters social engagement.</h3>

            <h3>To gain a deep understanding of the target group’s needs, we conducted <i>contextual inquiries</i> with six freshmen. We found that students primarily use two strategies for finding events:</h3>
            
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><strong>Active Search:</strong> Actively searching through search engines or student council mailing lists.</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="subcaption">Additional Insights</h3>
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li>Lack of a central hub for event information</li>
                <li>High importance of social groups in decision-making</li>
