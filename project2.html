            <h3>The ITHACA (Immersion and Training with Holograms for Art, Craft, and Audiovisual) project, funded by
                the European Union (No. 101104729), is a collaborative initiative involving multiple partners from
                research, industry, and creative fields. The project's goal is to make volumetric video technology more
                accessible and usable across various domains, including education, arts, and industry, by developing
                tools and workflows that simplify its creation, editing, and integration into Extended Reality (XR)
                applications.</h3>

            <h3 class="subcaption">Fraunhoferâ€™s Focus</h3>
            <h3>As part of the ITHACA project, Fraunhofer is responsible for developing the Volumetric Video Editor and
                Extended Reality Viewer, with a particular focus on their application in industrial training scenarios.

            <h3>
                To evaluate the usability of the XR Editor, we conducted a preliminary user study with a small number of participants. The study followed a <strong>think-aloud protocol</strong> during a guided use cases, where participants verbalized their thoughts while completing a predefined tasks within the XR environment. This approach helped us identify pain points and usability barriers in real-time.
            </h3>
            
            <h3>
                Following the task completion, participants filled out the <strong>System Usability Scale (SUS)</strong> to quantitatively assess perceived usability. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and provided a benchmark for overall system acceptance. Additionally, qualitative feedback was collected through semi-structured interviews to uncover deeper insights and user needs.
